## Short description
What is the performance issue?

## Reproduction data
- VjMapper version (commit / release)
- OS + version
- GPU + driver
- Scene/configuration description (resolution, number of channels/layers, shaders used)

## Measurements &amp; hints
- CPU/GPU usage (top, task manager, system profiler)
- Memory usage (RSS / GPU memory)
- FPS / frametimes (measurements if available)
- Profiling output (e.g. wgpu profiler, flamegraph)

## Steps to reproduce
- Concrete minimal steps

## Steps already tried
- [ ] Tested release build
- [ ] Tried different GPUs/drivers
- [ ] Simplified the scene (reduced assets)

## Expected behavior
- Target values (e.g. stable 60 FPS for X)

## Additional information
- Logs, small scene/project to reproduce, known workarounds

# Project Phases (0-7)

This document outlines the complete project roadmap for the MapFlow Rust rewrite, from the initial core engine development to the final polish and release.

## Phase Overview

*   **Phase 0: Foundation & Core Engine** - Setting up the Rust project, winit, and the basic rendering pipeline.
*   **Phase 1: Multi-Projector Support** - Implementing output management for multiple projectors.
*   **Phase 2: Effects & Shaders** - Building the WGSL shader system and a library of effects.
*   **Phase 3: Control & Integration** - OSC/MIDI control, FFmpeg integration for media playback.
*   **Phase 4: Asset & Preset Management** - Creating a library for effects, transforms, and project templates.
*   **Phase 5: Advanced UI (ImGui)** - Initial UI implementation using ImGui for core controls.
*   **Phase 6: Advanced UI (egui)** - A complete UI overhaul using the egui framework for a professional authoring experience, including a node editor, timeline, and asset browser.
*   **Phase 7: Performance, Polish & Release** - Profiling, stress testing, bug fixing, and preparation for the v1.0 release.

## Phase 7: Performance, Polish & Release

### Packaging & Distribution

- [x] **App Icon Embedding**
  - Uses `winres` to embed `mapmap.ico` into the Windows executable.
- [ ] **Windows Installer (WiX)**
  - Basic configuration (`main.wxs`) exists.
  - Needs verification of DLL bundling (FFmpeg) and shortcut creation.
- [ ] **Linux Packaging (.deb)**
  - Needs `cargo-deb` configuration in `Cargo.toml` or `debian/` control files.
- [ ] **AppImage / Flatpak** (Optional)
  - Evaluate for broader Linux compatibility.

## Phase 8: Multi-PC Architecture (NEW)

> **Detailed Documentation:** [`docs/03-ARCHITECTURE/MULTI-PC-FEASIBILITY.md`](../03-ARCHITECTURE/MULTI-PC-FEASIBILITY.md)

This phase enables distributed output across multiple PCs, supporting professional multi-projector installations.

### Phase Overview

| Sub-Phase | Option | Description | Duration |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **8.1** | Option A: NDI Streaming | Video streaming via NDI protocol | 3 weeks |
| **8.2** | Option C: Legacy Client | H.264/RTSP for old hardware | 2 weeks |

# Phase 1 Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-03
**Status:** 📋 Planned (Code Missing)

---

## Overview

The plans for Phase 1 (Core Playback & Layer System) are well-documented. However, the implementation has not yet begun, as the foundational code from Phase 0 is also missing.

## Discrepancy Note

The previous version of this document described an 86% complete implementation of the Phase 1 deliverables. This was inaccurate. A file system audit revealed that the `/crates` directory and all Rust source code are missing from the repository.

**The project's current state is documentation-only.**

## Planned Features

The following features are planned for Phase 1 but have not yet been implemented.

### Month 4: Layer System & Transform Foundation
- [ ] **Layer Controls:** Video fader, master fader, bypass, solo, master opacity, eject all.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Phase 0:** The foundational code must be implemented before Phase 1 can begin.
2.  **Begin Phase 1 Implementation:** Once the foundation is in place, the features listed above can be developed.

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is fully planned but not implemented. The immediate priority is to complete Phase 0.
